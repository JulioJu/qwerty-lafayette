Sample Layouts

# Qwerty

These layouts should be very straight-forward: the `1dk` is on the quote key (`'`), everything else is unchanged.

No `AltGr` layer.

# Dvorak

Dvorak layouts are a bit trickier to tweak. A good compromise is swap the quote (`'`) and dash (`-`) keys, and put the `1dk` on the new quote key.

No `AltGr` layer.

# Qwerty42

This category of layouts rely on a bit more changes:

- the colon key (`;:`) becomes a dedicated `1dk`;
- the colon & semi-colon signs are moved on `shift` + comma & dot keys;
- the `<>` signs are moved to the `AltGr` layer.

Another goal of these layouts is to fit on only 42 keys (the 10 number keys + the 3 rows of 10 keys under them + spacebar + `AltGr`), which makes them perfect for compact keyboards. All keys outside these 42 keys are duplicated to the `AltGr` layer, which has been optimized for programming symbols.

This could be the most efficient qwerty variant out there, especially for developers.
